## Civic Maps

There are multiple and overlapping histories of communities using maps for civic action, from participatory GIS to environmental justice, from indigenous land claims to crisis mapping. Currently, there is an explosion of new civic mapping tools and practices. For example, Open Street Maps allows large numbers of people to participate in improving an open map base; Grassroots Mapping provides tools for community-created aerial imagery layers; Ushahidi's hosted Crowdmap service allows quick and easy creation of incident report maps; etc.

In class:

- Blog post chat. (10 min)
- Students will talk about an ICCM experience, the Civic Maps Toolkit project and how we are defining civic maps.
- Jo will share a brief history of mapping and why we need a class of maps called "civic" maps. Jo will talk about who owns maps and why aren't they inherently useful for civic purposes and about civic mapping from a time before the internet. (30 min)
- Then we'll hear from some civic mapping practitioners about forms of civic mapping that they are currently working on. We'll ask probing questions about how these are and are not participatory and connected to action.
- Catherine talks about critical mapping. (25 min)
- Arlene talks about OpenIR and how it's being used. (20 min)
- 5 min break.
- Pablo talks about Meipi and Basurama. (15 min)
- Jeff talks about Grassroots mapping. (30 min)
- Hands on: Local Ground. (15 min)      
      
     

### Resources

- (Choose by theme) - choose a category you are interested in, get the contact info of the other students in the category; write up 5 resources that you find, keep in touch with each other about which resources you are writing about so that you don't duplicate. {{% resource_link "ce7e357e-ae90-4341-9e84-c752eb123c01" "Storymaps" %}} may also be interesting.      
      
    Take some time to brainstorm kinds of resources (when writing up, use tagging/writing instructions~)!.      
      
    - Walking Papers is a tool to submit hand-drawn contributions to {{% resource_link "1cf1c3fd-e157-4f5d-a7ed-441d0563c327" "http://www.openstreetmap.org/" %}} with corrections for new streets and street formations and details about the ways that buildings are occupied—public, private, residential, businesses. You can print out a map with a QR code, annotate by hand and send to Walking Papers who contribute it to OpenStreetMaps. The goal of Open Street Maps is to geospatial data in an open way to update and correct for the geospatial data sets available commercially that may be incorrect, out of date, misrepresentative.
    - {{% resource_link "cbe915d1-c016-40e6-a4ef-29055ab1306e" "Local Ground" %}} is a similar tool, but for creating your own maps rather than contributing to another mapping project. You can see {{% resource_link "27efb3d3-2a61-4598-ac8a-41640738e1bc" "examples of use" %}} on their website.
    - We'll break into small groups, print out maps either of our home areas or work areas (what do people prefer?) and in groups, choose things to map that are important to you—what are the routes you most commonly move along, what kinds of paths would you like; where do you hang out, why; where do you find groceries, other staples?; what would you add to your immediate surroundings if you could? Work together to share ideas about what you would like to share about this area and what you would like to change. After a bit, we'll try to take a picture of these and scan them into the platform to share them with each other.
